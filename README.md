## The Itch
You are working on that great software project... And you need to import all those images (from time to time) and you need to resize them according to a specific logic.
You are lazy, and it's such a tedious job. So you decide to automate it. You write a shell script and naturally ask yourself...
How general should the script be?
Maybe I'll introduce a few variables...
And so you wrote it and happy with it, you put it somewhere in your Dev folder and forget it.
Then just a few hours later you find another task to automate. Well you decide to make it official now and open a Scripts folder to hold all of these scripts. Your hacker traits push you to alias the scripts, so they're available right there on every terminal window. But then... So many questions start to pop up: the folder is growing with more and more tasks, how will I manage the scripts? Keep some metadata like description, arguments and so on.. They also have so much in common, how will I share those parts... Can I distribute them... Why Bash, how the hell do you write a for loop with that strange syntax...! And so many more questions...!
